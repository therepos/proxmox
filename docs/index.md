# About

This site documents the key pointers noted during my journey into self-hosting. The Proxmox [repository](https://github.com/therepos/proxmox) stores a collection of scripts created during the process to simplify the setup and maintenance. The technologies covered include [Proxmox], [Docker], [Git], [GitHub] and [Markdown].
