# About

This site documents the key pointers noted during my journey into self-hosting. The technologies covered include [Proxmox], [Docker], [Git], [GitHub] and [Markdown]. 

## Products

The Proxmox [repository](https://github.com/therepos/proxmox) stores a collection of scripts created during the process to simplify both setup and maintenance. 

```
proxmox/
├── apps/       # One-click installation scripts (inspired by tteck).
├── docker/     # Ready-to-run docker compose files.
├── docs/       # Documentation and notes.
├── old/        # Superceded scripts.
├── tools/      # One-click tool scripts for specific task.
```
