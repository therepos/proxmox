# Algorithm
#   Nearest: Fast but low quality. Use for speed over accuracy.
#   Triangle: Balanced speed and quality. Good general choice.
#   CatmullRom: Sharp results. Use for cartoon or crisp images.
#   Gaussian: Softens images. Good for noisy or blurry sources.
#   Lanczos3: Best for detail. Ideal for high-res or photographic images.
# Hash Size
#   8: Fast, less precise. Use for rough similarity.
#   16: Balanced. Default for general use.
#   32: Slower, very precise. Use for high accuracy needs.
# Hash Type
#   Mean: Identical/similar images.
#   Gradient: Light/shadow changes.
#   BlockMean: Partially similar images.
#   VertGradient / DoubleGradient: Orientation and finer changes.
